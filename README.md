# Design-Patterns
In this repository, I will systematically cover various design patterns and their implementations in Java. Each design pattern will be thoroughly explained along with code examples to illustrate their usage and benefits.

## Design Pattern Definition

- Design patterns are the well proved solution of commonly occuring problems in the software design.

## Types of Design Patterns

- There are 3 main types of Design Patterns:

(1) Creational Design Pattern
(2) Structural Design Pattern
(3) Behavioural Design Pattern

## (1) Creational Design Pattern

- These design patterns are responsible for class instantiation. They can be either class creation patterns or object-creation patterns.
- Below are the types of Creational Design Pattern:

(a) Singleton Pattern
(b) Factory Pattern
(c) Abstract Factory Pattern
(d) Builder Pattern
(e) Prototype Pattern

## (2) Structural Design Pattern

- These design patterns are responsible for class's structure and composition. The main functionality of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the classes involved without changing much of its composition.
- Below are the types of Structural Design Pattern:

(a) Adapter Pattern
(b) Bridge Pattern
(c) Composite Pattern
(d) Decorator Pattern
(e) Facade Pattern
(f) Flyweight Pattern
(g) Proxy Pattern

## (3) Behavioural Design Pattern

- These design patterns are responsible for how classes communicates with each other.
- Below are the types of Behavioural Design Pattern:

(a) Chain of Resposibility Pattern
(b) Command Pattern
(c) Interpreter Pattern
(d) Iterator Pattern
(e) Mediator Pattern
(f) Memento Pattern
(g) Observer Pattern
(h) State Pattern
(i) Strategy Pattern
(j) Template Pattern
(k) Visitor Pattern
