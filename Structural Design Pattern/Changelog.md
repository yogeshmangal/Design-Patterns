### Adapter Pattern

- The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making them work together. This pattern involves a single class, known as the adapter, which is responsible for joining functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.

### Bridge Pattern

- Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchiesâ€”abstraction and implementation which can be developed independently of each other.
