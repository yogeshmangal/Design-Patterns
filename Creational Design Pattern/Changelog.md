### Factory Pattern

- A Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

### Singleton Pattern

- The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
