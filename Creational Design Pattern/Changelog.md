### Factory Pattern

- A Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

### Abstract Factory Pattern

- Since in Factory Design Pattern, we saw that we have a single Factory class. This Factory class returns different subclasses based on the input provided and factory class uses if-else or switch statement to achive this. Now, in Abstract Factory Design Pattern, we get rid off if-else/switch block and have a factory class for each subclass. Then an Abstract Factory class that will return the subclass based on the input factory class.

### Singleton Pattern

- The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
