# Behavioural Design Patterns

### Observer Pattern

- The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern where an observable maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is commonly used to implement distributed event-handling systems.

### Mediator Pattern

- The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling by controlling communication between different objects. It centralizes communication between objects by introducing a mediator object that encapsulates how objects interact.

### Memento Pattern

- The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to capture its internal state and restore it later, without exposing its internal structure. It's like taking a snapshot of an object's state and being able to revert to that snapshot whenever needed.

- Here's a breakdown of the components of the Memento Pattern:

- a) Originator: This is the object whose state needs to be saved. It creates a memento object containing a snapshot of its current state and uses that memento to restore its state later.

- b) Memento: This is the object that stores the state of the originator. It has two main responsibilities: storing the state of the originator and providing access to the state for the originator.

- c) Caretaker: This is the object that keeps track of the mementos. It doesn't modify or even look inside the mementos; it just holds onto them and provides them back to the originator when needed.

- The Memento Pattern is useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo functionality, maintain a history of states, or provide a way to revert to previous states of an object.

### Interpreter Pattern

- The Interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language. It defines a grammatical representation for a language, as well as an interpreter that can interpret sentences in that language.

### Iterator Pattern

- The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object (such as a list) sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It separates the traversal logic from the aggregate object, making it possible to iterate over the elements of the collection in a uniform manner.

### Command Pattern

- The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It enables the separation of concerns between the sender (client) of a request and the receiver (the object that performs the action). This pattern consists of several key components:

- (a) Command: This represents an action to be performed. It typically includes a method that defines what action needs to be taken (e.g., execute()).
- (b) Receiver: This is the object that performs the action associated with the command.
- (c) Invoker: This asks the command to carry out the request. It doesn't have the knowledge of how the request is executed; it simply knows how to trigger it.
- (d) Client: This creates a concrete command object and sets its receiver. It then associates the command with the receiver.

- Note: In the code of Command Pattern: 
- (a) Command is Command interface and its subclass like LightOnCommand and LightOffCommand
- (b) Receiver is Light class.
- (c) Invoker is RemoteController class.
- (d) Client is Test class.

### Chain Of Responsibility Pattern

- The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioural pattern that allows a request to be passed alone a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it on the next handle in the chain. This pattern decouples senders and receivers of requests.
