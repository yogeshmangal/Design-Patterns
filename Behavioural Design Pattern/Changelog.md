### Chain Of Responsibility Pattern

- The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioural pattern that allows a request to be passed alone a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it on the next handle in the chain. This pattern decouples senders and receivers of requests.
